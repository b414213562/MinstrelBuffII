---------------------
Things to do before shipping the Priority Anthem feature as MinstrelBuff II v2.0.3:
---------------------
    Update the background to include a space for the anthem
---------------------

Snowball (blue tree) - track how many of the 7 heals have been done before Perfect Ending is unlocked.

Consider using skill & effect image ids instead of names to identify them.
    This would conflate the personal and fellowship effects, but they always have (approximately) the same duration.

Borrow idea of a tip window from Combat Analysis?
Take screenshots of new Anthems. Update Wiki?

BuffWindow's .window property should be done away with.
    Instead, use self.

Don't toss away information about ballads / anthems / etc. when changing the background image.

Now that the UI cares about the size of the screen,
    use the technique for detecting that the screen resolution has changed?

BuffWindow.nextAnthemEffectPlace is incredibly confusing to maintain code around.
    How about BuffWindow.activeAnthemCount?
    On the other hand, if this is going to be blown away by the upcoming minstrel changes,
        then maybe don't worry about it.

Main Window and Melodic Interlude:
    When scaling bar is changed, make window visible for a few seconds.

Melodic Interlude shortcuts:
    Is there Improved Raise the Spirit or Chord of Salvation? Do those use different hex codes?
        Needs testing on high-level minstrel before releasing patch.

Once an anthem or ballad, etc. is detected, use a Plugin specific value, like ANTHEM_I_COMPASSION = 723;
    Then we can do overlay lookups based on just this internal value, not needing to add it to the strings files.

Minstrel 3.0 thoughts:

Get rid of "not shortestRemainingTimeSet", use "shortestRemainingTime == 0"

Is the text over the effect still working?
    No! L, P, L+P is not working! - But I saw it working, so what's up?

Show UI all the time! (Maybe optionally when anthem cooldown expires, starting with visible?)
Other anthem changes:
    Change anthem timers to yellow when they get close to timing out

Add option to include personal anthem effects (on non-fixed display?). "P" overlay.

Emboldening Finish UI showing the stack from 1 to 5 (+5% to +25%)
UI for Anthem bonuses from Invigorating Anthems?
Internal 25 second cooldown on Improved Coda of Fury effect.
UI for "The 'Improved Inspire Fellows' trait will now cause Inspire Fellows 
    to tier up Inner Strength on your fellows, when the 'Inner Strength'
    trait is also active."?

Themes files: Can we change e.g. "ThemePath5" to "local ThemePath" instead?

On load, OptionWindow:PlaceControls is called twice...
    Called in ctor *AND* in semi-static but dependent-on-ctor function GetOptionControl.
    This may have been in order to support both window *and* in-options-panel display.

Instead of saving after every Up/Down click in Anthem Priority Options,
    start a 10? second timer that restarts after each up/down,
    on timer expiration, Save();
    Thought: Do this in settings:Save() itself, instead of for each option that wants it.
        When the plugin unloads, check for an uncompleted timer.

Change Theme list to a dropdown to save space? - Farothhen

Change variable names like Anthem1LesserResonance to include "Effect" like Anthem1LesserResonanceEffect
    In general name variables with effect or skill when talking about Anthems

Should the priority queue combine lesser & greater into a single row using the effect icon?
    Lesser only takes 1 ballad, greater takes 2, and lesser resonance / dissonance gives personal effect.

---

Misc:

Detection of which graphic to use for Third Age is based on stance, not trait tree
    Whenever stance changes, it might be because trait tree changed.
    Check for which anthem of the third age is trained.
    Fixed anthems assume only one Anthem of the Third Age can be active. This is not true.
        Interesting problem to solve (for me): Make "fixed" customizable: Pick which of the 8 anthems, in which order to display.
    ThemeNote - different images for Ballad and Anthem not handled with current multi-anthem support.
    ThemeNoWindowFourAnthems - Fix name? (It's only 3 anthems)

War-Speech Improvements:
    If there are three War-speeches, then color the timer in place #1 differently with < 2 seconds left.
    If a War-speech timer is active then visibility = true (for only-combat mode)

Soliloquy of Spirit window and main window show during hidden-hud when repostion is enabled.
(Other game windows do not.)

Look at Lua lib like ImgGui.

To-do items:
Beginning of stream 2022-04-12, collectgarbage("count"); returned values betwen 1215 and 1235.


Look through effect code, see what changes we could make for perfermance purposes. (Maybe don't sort all effects by time?)
Optimization thoughts:

Instead of copying every effect,
    have list of indicies that get sorted?
    have list of indicies that we care about?
        Don't copy and then sort a bunch of effects that aren't relevant

euroNormalize content in SettingsEncoder.lua is missing from lotrointreface released version.

French codas seem wrong. How are codas supposed to be used, and is that happening in French?
    Step 1: How do I get my improved codas?
    Step 2: What does that look like in the effect list?
    Step 3: Repeat on French client.

Sort out which Anthems are no longer valid, remove all traces of them!

---

Dynamically expand 'Window - Standard' if there are more than 3 anthems to display.
Change display of Anthem if player does not have it trained. (They can't be the one to rebuff it.)
    Ignore the edge case where an Anthem you're trained in is from someone else, and theirs is more powerful.

minstrel_buffbar_background:
Can we cut it into pieces and make it bigger that way?
