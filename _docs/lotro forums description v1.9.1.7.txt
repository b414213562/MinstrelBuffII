Version 1.9.1.7 of [url=https://lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1104-MinstrelBuffswithOut-Of-CombatTimer.html]MinstrelBuffs with Out-Of-Combat Timer[/url] is now available at lotrointerface.com.

This release includes several larger changes:

A new window for Melodic Interlude, a red-line effect that unlocks friendly healing for Dissonance-stance minstrels. This window includes a 10 second countdown timer and the two healing skills that are usable on friendly targets;

A new War-Speech UI for tracking how many War-Speech effects (+5% tactical damage) you have and how long until they expire:

(At this point most of the files have been modified and developer Melida seems to be inactive, so it might be time to roll everything together into a MinstrelBuffsII?)
