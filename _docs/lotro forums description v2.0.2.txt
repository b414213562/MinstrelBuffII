The initial release (version 2.0.2) of [url=https://lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1201-MinstrelBuffII.html]MinstrelBuff II[/url] is now available at lotrointerface.com.

This release focused on combining my long-running patch "MinstrelBuffs with Out-Of-Combat Timer" with support for the 2022 Minstrel update into a stand-alone plugin.

Specifically, the English, French, and German anthem and ballad effects have been updated.
Additionally, an overlay has been added to show if an anthem is Lesser (L), Greater (G), or both (L+G).

The fixed theme background images have been updated with the new anthem icons.
